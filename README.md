## Project Analysis
### Target Audience
Households and Businesses
### Success Criteria
We will be using the Firebase analytics model to generate time-to-time reports on the number of usage, analysis, and recommendations happening over a particular time frame. Attach Rate & download numbers might show about application's popularity but the application will be successful only if it can help reduce food waste for a large number of people fulfilling its primary purpose. We will analyze the number of recommendations and inventory optimizations happening through the application & number of active households, businesses & food banks connected through our system to analyze application success over time.
### Competitor Analysis

This application mainly talks about California, could not find any details about people using it in Seattle.
#### Ample harvest:
This does not exactly deal with leftovers, It mainly focuses on creating free pantries where people go and take food whenever they are hungry.

### Monetization Model
1. Funding/Donations- Millions of dollars are donated annually to support such non-profit causes & organizations. Feeding America Organization help in generating revenue for such activities across the state. Donors who provide food in good faith are protected by both State and Federal Good Samaritan laws designed to encourage donation of needed foods and protect donors. We plan to get some external funding for the project once we have a stable prototype version of the application ready.
2. Advertisements- Advertisements will also be used initially to generate basic revenue for the application maintenance & support.
